# WhatsApp Campaign Use Cases

## What is a Campaign?

A campaign is a way to send the same message to multiple customers at once using templates. Think of it like sending a newsletter, but through WhatsApp instead of email.

## Common Use Cases

When new customers sign up or make their first purchase:
```
Template: "Hi {{customerName}}! Welcome to {{businessName}}. Your order #{{orderNumber}} is confirmed. Need help? Just reply here!"

Phone Numbers: All new customers from this week
Timing: Immediately after signup
```

### 2. **Order Updates**
Keep customers informed about their purchases:
```
Template: "Good news {{customerName}}! Your order #{{orderNumber}} has shipped and will arrive by {{deliveryDate}}. Track: {{trackingLink}}"

Phone Numbers: Customers with shipped orders
Timing: When items ship
```

### 3. **Appointment Reminders**
For service businesses (doctors, salons, etc.):
```
Template: "Hi {{customerName}}, reminder: You have an appointment tomorrow at {{time}} with {{serviceName}}. Reply YES to confirm or CANCEL to reschedule."

Phone Numbers: Customers with appointments tomorrow
Timing: 24 hours before appointment
```

### 4. **Promotional Offers**
Marketing campaigns for sales or special offers:
```

Phone Numbers: Your customer list
Timing: Friday morning for weekend sales
```

### 5. **Payment Reminders**

Template: "Hi {{customerName}}, your invoice #{{invoiceNumber}} for ${{amount}} is due. Pay easily via: {{paymentLink}}"

Phone Numbers: Customers with overdue payments
Timing: 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after due date
```

### 6. **Customer Surveys**
Collect feedback after service:
```
Template: "How did we do {{customerName}}? Rate your experience from 1-5 by replying with a number. Your feedback helps us improve!"

Phone Numbers: Recent customers
Timing: 2 days after service completion
```

### 7. **Event Announcements**
Inform customers about upcoming events:
```
Template: "You're invited {{customerName}}! Join us for our exclusive customer event on {{eventDate}} at {{location}}. RSVP: {{rsvpLink}}"

Phone Numbers: VIP customers
Timing: 2 weeks before event
```

### 8. **Abandoned Cart Recovery**
E-commerce follow-up:
```
Template: "Hi {{customerName}}, you left {{itemName}} in your cart. Complete your purchase now and get free shipping! {{cartLink}}"
