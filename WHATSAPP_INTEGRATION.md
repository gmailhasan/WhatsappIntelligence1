# WhatsApp Integration Guide

## How WhatsApp Messaging Works in Your Platform

Your platform sends messages to end users through the **WhatsApp Business API**, which is the official way to send automated messages to customers. Here's how it works:

### Current Implementation Status

**Development Mode (Current):**
- Messages are logged to console for testing
- No actual WhatsApp messages sent
- Perfect for development and testing

**Production Mode (Ready to Enable):**
- Real WhatsApp messages sent via Facebook's Graph API
- Messages appear in customers' WhatsApp apps
- Full delivery status tracking

### How Messages Are Sent

1. **Campaign Creation**: You create a campaign with phone numbers and a template
2. **Template Processing**: Variables in templates are replaced with actual data
3. **WhatsApp API Call**: The platform calls WhatsApp Business API to send messages
4. **Delivery Tracking**: WhatsApp confirms delivery and provides status updates

### Message Flow Example

```
Your Platform → WhatsApp Business API → WhatsApp Servers → Customer's Phone
```

When a customer receives a message:
- It appears in their WhatsApp app
- They can reply directly
- Their replies come back to your platform as webhooks
- AI generates responses using your website content

### Setting Up Real WhatsApp Integration

To enable actual WhatsApp messaging, you need:

#### 1. WhatsApp Business Account
- Create a Facebook Business Manager account
- Set up WhatsApp Business API access
- Get your business verified by Facebook

#### 2. Required Credentials
- `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your app's access token
- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`: Your WhatsApp Business phone number ID
- `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`: For webhook verification

#### 3. API Setup Process
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/
2. Create a new app for "Business"
3. Add WhatsApp product to your app
4. Configure webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/whatsapp/webhook`
5. Get phone number ID and access token

#### 4. Message Templates
WhatsApp requires pre-approved templates for marketing messages:
- Create templates in Facebook Business Manager
- Get them approved by WhatsApp
- Reference them in your campaigns

### Current Features Working

✅ **Template System**: Create messages with variables like {{customerName}}
✅ **Bulk Messaging**: Send to multiple phone numbers at once
✅ **AI Responses**: Automatic replies using your website content
✅ **Conversation Tracking**: Monitor all customer interactions
✅ **Campaign Management**: Schedule and track message campaigns

### Testing the Current System

The platform logs messages to the console when you:
1. Create a campaign
2. Send bulk messages
3. Trigger AI responses

Check the server logs to see:
```
[DEV] WhatsApp send to +1234567890: Hello John! Welcome to our service.
```

3. **Configure Webhook**: Point to your deployed application
4. **Add Environment Variables**: WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN and WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
